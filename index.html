      <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>Hello all, this is the site to currently hold my project, "Rustic", and is currently under construction. Rustic I plan to make as a steampunk themed mod. I am currently new to the whole Minecraft modding scene, so you will have to forgive any delay in updates/releases. </p>



<h2>About</h2>

<p>I am currently taking classes and self teaching myself Java. I started out using Lua thanks to <a href="http://www.computercraft.info/">Computercraft</a>. I decided to move onto Java to start looking into Minecraft Modding. As I learn better skills, I plan to apply them to the mod to make it more like I vision it.</p>

<h2>Plans</h2>
<p>Here are some of the ideas I am going to be starting with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Steam power(not steam that goes into engines but into the machines themselves)</li>
  <li>Prototyping Table(5x5 crafting grid with 4 tool slots)</li>
  <li>Mechanical Spider fimliar</li>
  <li>Cook Stove</li>
  <li>Decor Blocks, such as a Grandfather Clock</li>
  <li>Steampunk themed tools and weapons</li>
  <li>Custom rendered armor</li>
</ul>
<p>These will most likely change, mainly due to the fact that I still need to learn how to make some of the items. I plan to have more then just this, like I said this is just a start.

<p>Currently I am currently the only author for Rustic. I would be willing to allow other contributors that wish to help. Right now the main thing I am currently looking for right now is some to do textures. I been currently doing my own work, but not the biggest fan of it. In saying that if you would like to help in some way let me know and well see if we can't work something out.</p>
<p>Even though I am currently the only contributor, I have had help from many to get the knowledge I have now.</p>
