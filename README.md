===========
This is a steampunk themed mod that is in the works. I can not tell you exactly what will entail for the mod because even I don't know to an extent. 

Planned fetures are:
- Steam power(not steam that goes into engines but into the machines themselves)
- Prototyping Table(5x5 crafting grid)
- Mechanical Spider familair
- Steam Gun
- Cook Stove
- Steampunk Themed tools and weapons(debating)
- Custom Rendered armor(debating)
- Other steampunk items that I havent tohught of yet.

###About
***

I am currently a student attending College for Java programming. I have done a lot of self teaching programming in Java, but decided to go to school anyways to mainly learn how to apply the knowledge correctly. This is my third attempt at making a mod where as the first two where throw aways to mainly get the handle of things.

###Contributing
***

I can not say hey give me this or that because I havent done anything. On the other hand, I am still learning Java and especially learning they way Minecraft is coded. If you wish to help in certain ways I will being willing to accept it. The two main things I already know I need help with would be:
- power system (learning how to do packets handling to make machines and a power netowrk)
- Textures (I've done all of my own currently, but I'm a little anal about how things look, and I don't like my own skills with textures)
 

###Contact
***
At this point the best way to contact me would be on the website for the server I help run which is [Peacecraft](http://www.peacecraft-ec.com) I am the game manager for the site with the name bigbaddevil7.
